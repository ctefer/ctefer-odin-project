# Odin Project
My dive into the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/).


## Caution
This project is not intended for use by anyone starting on the Odin Project. Based
on my own experiences and knowledge, I've skipped critical steps that would not benefit
the learning of anyone new to Odin.
